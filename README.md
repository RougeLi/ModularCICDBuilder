# Modular CI/CD Builder: Streamlining Jenkins Automation

The Modular CI/CD Builder is a pioneering toolkit that transforms the landscape of Continuous Integration and Continuous
Deployment (CI/CD) within the Jenkins ecosystem. As a highly modular Shared Library conceived for integration with
Jenkins Global Pipeline Libraries, it represents the epitome of innovative automation. Adopting a script-based pipeline
approach, the project emphasizes modularity and customization, serving Jenkins Jobs with unrivaled efficiency. Designed
to provide a flexible and scalable solution, the Modular CI/CD Builder utilizes a range of design patterns to
effectively support complex CI/CD workflows and requirements.

## Why This Project?

In a landscape where efficiency and speed are paramount, the Modular CI/CD Builder emerges as a crucial asset. It's more
than a portfolio piece; it's my commitment to advancing automation technologies. While the project is open for community
input and evolution, its core lies in enabling developers to achieve more with lessâ€”less time, less overhead, and fewer
complications.

## Core Features & Highlights

- **Docker Integration**: Deep integration with Docker supports containerization and artifact image CI processes that
  streamline the entire development lifecycle.

  Loading, to enhance code maintainability and extensibility.
- **Versatility**: Adaptable to a range of deployment scenarios, from simple app rollouts to intricate multiService
  architectures.

## Getting Started with Modular CI/CD Builder

### Prerequisites

To utilize the Modular CI/CD Builder, your Jenkins environment must be pre-configured with essential global properties.
Key-Value pairs and Jenkins credentials form the backbone of the framework, enabling its core functionality.

### Jenkinsfile Initiation & Quick Start

The primary method of engaging with the Modular CI/CD Builder is through the creation of a `jenkinsfile`. This file
should reference `ModularArtifactPipeline.groovy` located in the `vars` directory of this project and must be configured
with the necessary parameters to initiate the pipeline. Here's how to get started:

1. Ensure all prerequisites are met within your Jenkins setup.
2. Import the Modular CI/CD Builder shared library into Jenkins.
3. Create a `jenkinsfile` that includes and correctly sets up all required parameters for your build and deployment
   processes.

The `jenkinsfile` acts as the operational core, interfacing with the Modular CI/CD Builder to orchestrate and execute
your CI/CD pipeline.

```groovy
// A snippet showing how to structure the jenkinsfile parameters
// Define images and build arguments
String nextJsImage = '...' // Image for Next.js service
String ansibleImage = '...' // Image for Ansible service
// ... other parameter definitions ...

// Define Docker Compose settings
Map DockerComposeMap = [
        // ... Docker Compose configurations ...
]

// Invoke the Modular Artifact Pipeline script
ModularArtifactPipeline {
    // ... settings and configurations ...
}
```

A complete `jenkinsfile` example, detailing the specific parameters and structures, should be provided in the
documentation to guide users through setting up their own pipelines.

## Setup and Execution

To utilize the Modular CI/CD Builder, users must first fulfill specific Jenkins setup steps, such as defining
environmental variables and credentials. A step-by-step guide will be provided to ensure a seamless integration into the
Jenkins pipeline.

### Configurable Parameters and Their Mappings

- `BUILD_PLATFORM`: Determines the build context (e.g., 'docker'). It maps to a specific Groovy script
  like `src/pipeline/artifact/ci/build/docker.groovy` which contains the logic for Docker-based builds.

- `BUILD_WORK_FLOW_ARGS_LIST`: Supplies the necessary arguments for the specified `BUILD_PLATFORM`. This list contains
  configuration details like Docker image names, Dockerfile templates, and more.

- `BUILD_TYPE`: Indicates the trigger type for the build process (e.g., 'Manual'), allowing for different types of build
  initiation.

- `MODULE`: Specifies the strategy module to be used (e.g., 'DockerCompose'). This maps to a Groovy script such
  as `src/pipeline/module/strategy/DockerCompose.groovy`, which orchestrates the Continuous Deployment process using
  Docker Compose.

- `MODULE_ARG_MAP`: Provides the required arguments for the specified `MODULE`. This map includes necessary details for
  the deployment process, like credential IDs, project names, and service configurations.

## `jenkinsfile` Example

A `jenkinsfile` serves as the entry point for the Jenkins pipeline, referencing the `ModularArtifactPipeline.groovy`
script and specifying the parameters that guide the automation process. Below is a conceptual outline of
a `jenkinsfile`:

```groovy
@Library('ModularCICD@VERSION') _

// Define Docker images and other parameters
String dockerImage = 'your-docker-image'
// ... other parameter definitions ...

// Set up build and module arguments
ArrayList buildArgs = [ /* ... build arguments ... */]
Map moduleArgs = [/* ... module arguments ... */]

// Execute the Modular Artifact Pipeline
ModularArtifactPipeline {
    // ... settings and configurations ...
}
```

This example illustrates how users can customize their CI/CD pipeline execution by specifying various parameters,
adhering to the IoC principle.
